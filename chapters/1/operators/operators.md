## Unary Operators

A unary operator is just an operator that takes one value.

A binary operator is an operator that takes two values.

Not all operators are symbols, some are written as words.

For example, the *typeof* operator, which names the type of the value you give it
```
console.log(typeof(4));
// number

console.log(typeof('Hey friend'));
// string
```
