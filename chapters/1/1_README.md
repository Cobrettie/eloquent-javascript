# Ah yes, Chapter One. We begin with values, types, and operators

## Values 

In the computer's world, there is only data. We as humans, are simply viewing that data. Every single thing you see on a computer screen, is data.

We as humans, can do many things with that data, such as reading, modifying, creating new data, etc.

Well how does the computer know what we are requesting?

Every action produces bits. Bits are what your computer needs to display data. 

Bits are any kind of two-valued things, such as zeros and ones. Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequence of zeroes and ones and represented in bits.

Numbers, letters, mouse/keyboard events, any single thing you can do on a computer, can be reduced to bits. It's an extremely complex world behind the scenes in a computer.
